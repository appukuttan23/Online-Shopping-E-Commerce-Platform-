# Online-Shopping-E-Commerce-Platform-


The E-commerce Management System will primarily provide a platform to
purchase, distribute items, product or service through the internet and on some
other network, while a shop is available only at day time the e-commerce is
available 24 hours of a day and seven days of the week.
In this DBMS project we will design an e-commerce platform where a customer
can register and buy a product. If it is an already existing customer the system
skips the registration and enters a window where he/she could enter their user’s
name and password which thereby gives access to the e-commerce platform. The
platform has a registration window where the system provides the customers with
unique user IDs and customer IDs and they also have the option to set up their
passwords. In this platform products are listed with their prices. And during the
purchase the customer has an option to specify the quantity of the particular item to
be purchased. And at the checkout the customer is provided with an invoice, and a
receipt containing the customer’s personal Information and details of his purchase.
